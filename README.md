# Halo Xenotypes

A quick mod I whipped up with the little knowledge I have for modding RimWorld.

## Spartan II

### Information

* Spartan IIs' are highly augmented, highly trained, and have superhuman healing abilities. 

* They are horrible at household tasks. Combined with their Mjolnir armor, they are a formidable fighting force.

### Lore

> Originally made by ONIs' Dr Halsey, Spartan IIs' were just children when they were kidnapped and indoctrinated as part of the Spartan II program. 

> Contrary to the ORION program, Spartan IIs' are not just drugged up soldiers but instead they are genetically and cybernetically enhanced.

## Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST)

### Information

* ODST, short for Orbital Drop Shock Troopers, are heavily trained and very disciplined. 

* They aren't very good at household tasks, but throw them a MA5C and they might just *shock* you...

### Lore

> Early versions of ODST were introduced to the UNSC around 2129, but didn't gain notoriety until 2525 when the Human-Covenent war broke out. 

> Unlike Spartan IIs', ODSTs' were once normal soldiers.
